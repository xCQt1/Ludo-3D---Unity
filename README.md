# Ludo-3D---Unity

This is a 3D game of the popular boardgame Ludo (or Mensch Ã¤rgere dich nicht, as called in Germany), made for a school project.

This project aims to provide a simple, enjoyable experience with a simple, mouse-based UI and a (maybe at some point) good looking environment, all while keeping the nostalgic and original aesthetic of the original game.

Specific features as of Version 0.3 are:
- fully functional game with all rules implemented
- a minimal but intuitive UX
- basic animations
- bots, you as a player can play with

Some additional features, that per se aren't necessary but still would provide a better UX, like menus, some toasts to provide some feedback to the player, additional animations and similar are to be implemented soon.
